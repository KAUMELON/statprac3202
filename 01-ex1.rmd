# Exercise 1 

## Construction of Frequency Distribution  

[Steps in construction of frequency distribution]{.ul}:  

+ Determine the number of classes  
+ Determine the class width  
+ Set up the individual class limits  
+ Tally the items into the classes  
+ Count the number of items in each class  

Table 1.1 below shows the data related to the grain yield in (g /plot) of a sorghum variety from experimental plots of equal area from a continuous frequency distribution. Prepare a frequency distribution and cumulative frequency distribution

```{r t11, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt<-read.csv("csv/freqdist.csv")
dt %>%
  kbl(caption = "Frequency distribution ",col.names = NULL) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```
[**SOLUTION**]{.ul}:  


Number of Classes, *k* =1 + 3.322 log~10~*N* =  

Class width, C = \| max - min\|/ k =  

Lower limit as L = min - $\frac{c^{'} - k^{'} - (max - min)}{2}$ =
